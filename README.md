# Excess-potential-connectivity
Matlab code and data intended as supplementary material to the paper ‘Excess Neuronal Branching Allows for Local Innervation of Specific Dendritic Compartments in Mature Cortex’ (Cerebral Cortex, 10.1093/cercor/bhaa271).

The two scripts in 'all_functions' reproduce the figures and tables in the paper. 'plot_all_figures.m' uses the data generated in the original simulations to exactly reproduce the paper. 'evaluate_all_data.m' regenerates the data as well. As there is some stochasticity in the simulations for the first two figures, the results of 'evaluate_all_data.m' may differ slightly from those published.
